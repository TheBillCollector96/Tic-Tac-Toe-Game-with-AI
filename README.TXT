# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-with-AI
This repository contains Java code of a Tic-Tac-Toe Game with an AI algorithm that minimizes your chances of winning by 90% !!! You could never beat it even if you try. Your best luck is to achieve a draw with it. It makes use of a generic LinkedList as a data structure to keep track of each player's moves and the MiniMax algorithm which the AI uses to predict and make decisions about it's next move. This project was developed using BlueJ, however, you can always create similar classes then copy and paste the algorithm if you're using a different IDE. Enjoy and Happy Learning !!!

To run it, open the project in BlueJ or double click on the packet.bluej file required you have BlueJ installed on you computer. After opening it, Right click on the "Tic-Tac-Toe" class then click on "void main(string[]args)" and the game will run. Follow each instruction given to play the game and have fun. 

Furthermore, you can double click on each class to view the code and learn. Make as many changes as you want to the code, don't be scared. If you ruin it, you can always get it from my GitHub Repository again.
